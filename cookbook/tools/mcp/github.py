"""🐙 MCP GitHub Agent - Your Personal GitHub Explorer!

This example shows how to create a GitHub agent that uses MCP to explore,
analyze, and provide insights about GitHub repositories. The agent leverages the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) to interact with GitHub, allowing it to answer questions
about issues, pull requests, repository details and more.

Example prompts to try:
- "List open issues in the repository"
- "Show me recent pull requests"
- "What are the repository statistics?"
- "Find issues labeled as bugs"
- "Show me contributor activity"

Run: `pip install agno mcp openai` to install the dependencies
Environment variables needed:
- Create a GitHub personal access token following these steps:
    - https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github#setup
- GITHUB_TOKEN: Your GitHub personal access token
