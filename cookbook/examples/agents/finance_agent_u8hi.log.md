The data appears to be a list of daily stock prices for a specific company, with each row representing a single day's worth of data.

To extract the opening price, I will use Python and pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = '''... your data here'''

df = pd.read_csv(pd.compat.StringIO(data))

# Extract open price
open_price = df['Open']

print(open_price)
```

This code creates a pandas DataFrame from the given data and then prints out the opening prices for each day.

Let me know if you'd like to know anything else about this data.
