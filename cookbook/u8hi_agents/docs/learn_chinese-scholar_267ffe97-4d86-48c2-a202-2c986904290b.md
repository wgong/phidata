how to create genAI app that is based on AI agents

### ðŸ¤– Assistant
Creating a generative AI application based on AI agents involves a combination of understanding the underlying AI models, choosing the right development platforms, and implementing your creative vision through programming and deployment. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

### 1. **Understand the Basics of AI Agents**
AI agents can be classified into several categories based on their decision-making processes, such as model-based, goal-based, and utility-based agents. The choice of agent affects how it will operate within your application. [Learn more about AI agents on Medium](https://medium.com/ai-agent-insider/build-an-ai-agent-from-scratch-2796150db2b2).


### 2. **Choose a Development Environment**
Various platforms assist in building and deploying generative AI applications. Some notable platforms include:

- **Azure AI Agent Service**: Provides a managed service for building, deploying, and scaling AI agents. This platform is useful for those who prefer managed services without worrying about underlying compute resources. [Read about deploying Azure AI services](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/deploy-your-first-azure-ai-agent-service-on-azure-app-service/4396173).

- **Vertex AI by Google**: Offers a no-code agent building console for creating generative AI experiences. It is user-friendly and involves using Google's latest AI models. [Explore the Vertex AI Agent Builder](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/build-generative-ai-experiences-with-vertex-ai-agent-builder).

- **Databricks for Generative AI**: Uses the Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation and Framework to take you from a proof-of-concept to a production-ready app. [Check out their end-to-end guide](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/tutorials/ai-cookbook/introduction).

### 3. **Implement and Train the Model**
- Depending on the complexity of your application, choose an appropriate AI model. If it's a text-based generation, models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) can be used.
- Customize and train your AI model using a dataset specific to your applicationâ€™s requirements.

### 4. **Develop the Application**
- **Programming**: You can use programming languages like Python for developing the logic and functionality of your app.
- **Integration**: Integrate the AI models with user interfaces and workflows.

### 5. **Deploy the Application**
- Utilize cloud platforms such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for hosting your application, ensuring it is scalable and accessible.
- Monitor application performance and iteratively improve it based on user feedback and performance metrics.

### 6. **Considerations for Real-world Applications**
- Ensure compliance with data privacy laws and ethical AI usage guidelines.
- Plan for continuous learning and updating of your AI model to adapt to new data and insights.

This process may involve collaborative work with data scientists, developers, and UI/UX designers to bring the generative AI application to life effectively. Would you like to know more about any specific part of the process?

in Agno, how to enable memory feature when working with agents

### ðŸ¤– Assistant
To enable the memory feature when working with agents in Agno, you can follow a straightforward process. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide:

### 1. **Understand Agno's Memory Types**
Agno provides several types of memory management:

- **Persistent Memory**: This allows memories to be stored across sessions, enabling users to continue their conversations seamlessly.
- **Session Memory**: Temporary storage that lasts only while the session is active.
- **User Memories**: Specific user data, like preferences, which can be stored for personalized interactions.
- **Summaries**: Condensed versions of long conversations to optimize the memory usage.

### 2. **Setting Up Memory Management in Agno**
To enable memory management, you need to integrate the memory-related classes provided by Agno into your agent. Here are the steps one might typically follow:

- **Import the Memory Class**: Start by importing the relevant memory management classes from Agno.

```python
from agno.memory import AgentMemory
```

- **Initialize Memory**: When creating your agent, you need to initialize the memory component.

```python
agent_memory = AgentMemory()
```

- **Configure Persistence**: To make memories persist across sessions, you'll need to implement a storage solution. This often involves using a database to store the agent sessions.

```python
agent_memory.set_storage(database_connection)
```

### 3. **Managing Memory during Interactions**
- **Storing Messages**: As the agent interacts with users, you can store each message and relevant data in the agent's memory.

```python
agent_memory.remember("user_message", "Agent_response")
```

- **Fetching Memory**: If users return for follow-up interactions, the agent can retrieve past conversations or specific memories.

```python
previous_memory = agent_memory.retrieve("user_id")
```

### 4. **Implementing Summary and User Preferences**
- Utilize the summary feature to condense long conversations and make interactions more manageable. Store user preferences in a dedicated section of the memory for easy access.

### 5. **Testing and Iterating**
After implementing the memory feature, itâ€™s crucial to test its functionality and iterate based on user feedback. This helps ensure that the memory feature operates smoothly and meets user needs.

### Additional Resources
For more detailed information, visit the official Agno documentation:
- [Memory Management in Agno](https://docs.agno.com/agents/memory)
- [Agent Memory Reference](https://docs.agno.com/reference/agents/memory)

These resources offer extensive insights into using Agno's memory capabilities effectively.
