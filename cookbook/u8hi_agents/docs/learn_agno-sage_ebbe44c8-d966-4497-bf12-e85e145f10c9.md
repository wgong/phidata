### Overview of Agno

**Agno** is a lightweight library designed to build **Multimodal Agents** that enhance the capabilities of Language Learning Models (LLMs). This library provides a unified API that empowers agents with superpowers such as memory, knowledge, tools, and reasoning capabilities, enabling them to perform actions across different media types including text, images, audio, and video.

#### Key Features
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: Agno supports various forms of outputs including text, images, audio, and video, making it highly versatile.
- **Unified API**: It simplifies interaction with LLMs, allowing for smoother integration and development of intelligent agents.
- **Powerful Enhancements**: The library allows you to add memory, domain knowledge, and tools to your agents, which can autonomously solve problems and interact with external systems through APIs and web queries.

#### Performance
Agno is noted for its speed, significantly outperforming other libraries like LangGraph. Its design prioritizes efficiency, making it suitable for real-time and dynamic applications.

### Documentation
The official Agno documentation is available at [Agno Documentation](https://docs.agno.com). Key sections include:
- **[Introduction to Agents](https://docs.agno.com/agents/introduction)**: This section explains how agents operate and their functionalities, including memory management, knowledge integration, and tool usage.
- **[Getting Started with Agno](https://docs.agno.com/introduction)**: A guide for developers to quickly set up and use Agno in their projects.
